# TO DO
- [x] Adjust page background and content backgrounds (rows) to have more contrast (lighter color for content background?)
- [x] Move neon text affect to it's own CSS class (it's currently under "maintitle" class)
- [ ] Move "listen now" buttons to be centered under text combo description
  - [ ] Maybe move header to be centered over img and description?
- [x] Add neon to inner blocks headers
- [x] Make neon borders bigger / more obvious (too subtle)
- [x] Add padding between maintitle on each page (that's not the index) and the navbar
- [x] Make navbar text bigger
- [x] Change navbar text color
- [x] Reduce space between navbar links
- [ ] Add dropdown to navbar?
- [ ] Maybe change the maintitle header on the shows page to stay on "podcasts", and then change the "about" to the podcast title?
